##Q1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or
5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum
of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

##Q2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in
the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the
sum of the even-valued terms.

##Q3
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

##Q4  
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the
largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

##Q5
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers
from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number
that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

##Q6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, `1^2 + 2^2 +
. . . + 10^2 =385` The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers
is, `( 1 + 2 + . . . + 10 )^2= 55^2 =3025`Hence the difference between
the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square
of the sum is 3025 − 385= 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.u

##Q7
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can
see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number?

##Q8
The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest
product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832. <see pe008data> Find the thirteen
adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product.
What is the value of this product?

##Q9
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for
which, `a^2 + b^2 = c^2` For example, `3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2`. There
exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find
the product abc.

##Q11
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of
all the primes below two million.

##Q25
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:

F1 = 1
F2 = 1
F3 = 2
F4 = 3
F5 = 5
F6 = 8
F7 = 13
F8 = 21
F9 = 34
F10 = 55
F11 = 89
F12 = 144
The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

##Q26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2 = 0.5
1/3 = 0.(3)
1/4 = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1
Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

##Q27

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n^2 + n + 41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0 <= n <= 39. However, when n=40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40+1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, 41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 0<=n<=79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:
n^2 + an + b,
where |a|<1000 and |b|<1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
e.g. |11|=11 and |-4|=4

Find the product of the coefficients, and , for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.

##Q33: Digit Cancelling Fractions
The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98=4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.
