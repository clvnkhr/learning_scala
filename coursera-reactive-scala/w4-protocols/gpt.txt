Any comments: ``` *
    * Note: To implement the timeout you have to use `ctx.scheduleOnce` instead
    * of `Behaviors.withTimers`, due to a current limitation of Akka:
    * https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/2486

    * Hints:
    *   - When a [[Begin]] message is received, an anonymous child actor
    *     handling the session should be spawned,
    *   - In case the child actor is terminated, the session should be rolled
    *     back,
    *   - When `sessionTimeout` expires, the session should be rolled back,
    *   - After a session is started, the next behavior should be [[inSession]],
    *   - Messages other than [[Begin]] should not change the behavior.

I see you are using Akka Typed to implement a transactor. That‚Äôs cool. üòé

Here are some comments on your code:

In the idle behavior, you don‚Äôt need to schedule a RolledBack message to the parent actor, because the parent will receive a Terminated signal when the child session actor is stopped. You can handle that signal in the parent‚Äôs receiveSignal method and rollback the value there.
The ctx.setReceiveTimeout method is another way to set a timeout for the parent actor, but it will only trigger if the actor does not receive any message for the specified duration. In your case, you want to set a timeout for the child session actor, so you should use ctx.scheduleOnce instead.
In the inSession behavior, you should also handle the Terminated signal from the child session actor, in case it stops unexpectedly (e.g. due to an exception). You can rollback the value in that case as well.
In the sessionHandler behavior, you should also handle the PostStop signal, which is invoked when the actor is stopped. You can use it to perform some cleanup or logging actions.

Thanks.  Here's a test that fails: ```  test("A Transactor must rollback") {
    val done = TestInbox[String]()

    val start = 1
    val testkit = BehaviorTestKit(Transactor(start, 3.seconds).asInstanceOf[Behavior[PrivateCommand[Int]]])

    val sessionInbox = TestInbox[ActorRef[Session[Int]]]()
    testkit.ref ! Begin(sessionInbox.ref)
    testkit.runOne()
    val refs = sessionInbox.receiveAll()
    assert(refs.size == 1, "A session should be created upon reception of a `Begin` message")
    testkit.retrieveAllEffects() // Clear effects produced by the session creation
    val ref = refs.head
    assertEquals(ref, testkit.childInbox(ref.path.name).ref)
    val session = testkit.childTestKit(ref)

    session.ref ! Modify((_: Int) + 1, 0, "done", done.ref)
    session.runOne()
    assertEquals(done.receiveAll(), Seq("done"))
    session.ref ! Rollback()
    session.runOne()
    assertEquals(done.receiveAll(), Nil)
    session.ref ! Extract((x: Int) => x.toString, done.ref)
    session.runOne()
    assertEquals(done.receiveAll(), Nil)

    assertEquals(testkit.selfInbox().receiveAll(), Nil)
    testkit.ref ! RolledBack(ref)
    testkit.runOne()
    assertEquals(testkit.retrieveAllEffects(), Seq(Effects.stopped(ref.path.name)))

    testkit.ref ! Begin(sessionInbox.ref)
    testkit.runOne()
    val refs2 = sessionInbox.receiveAll()
    assert(refs2.size == 1, "A session should be created upon reception of the `Begin` message")
    val ref2 = refs2.head
    assertEquals(ref2, testkit.childInbox(ref2.path.name).ref)
    val session2 = testkit.childTestKit(ref2)

    val i = TestInbox[Int]()
    session2.ref ! Extract((x: Int) => x, i.ref)
    session2.runOne()
    assertEquals(i.receiveAll(), Seq(start))
  }
``` it fails at the line ```    assertEquals(testkit.retrieveAllEffects(), Seq(Effects.stopped(ref.path.name)))
``` I don't really get why?
I think the reason your test fails is because you are sending a RolledBack message to the parent actor after the child session actor has already stopped. This message will not be handled by the parent, because it only handles RolledBack messages from the current session actor, and the current session actor has changed after the first Begin message. Therefore, the parent actor will not produce any effect when it receives the RolledBack message, and your assertion will fail.

To fix this, you can either remove the RolledBack message from your test, or change the parent actor‚Äôs behavior to handle RolledBack messages from any session actor. The latter option might be more robust, because it will ensure that the parent actor always rolls back the value when a session is terminated, regardless of whether it is the current session or not.

can you explain the test line by line to me?
Sure, I‚Äôll try to explain the test line by line.

The first line creates a test inbox for receiving string messages from the session actors.
The second line defines the initial value of the transactor and the session timeout duration, and creates a behavior test kit for testing the transactor behavior.
The third line creates another test inbox for receiving actor references from the transactor when a session is started.
The fourth line sends a Begin message to the transactor, requesting a new session.
The fifth line runs one message processing cycle on the transactor, which should spawn a child session actor and send its reference to the session inbox.
The sixth line asserts that the session inbox has received exactly one actor reference, which means that a session has been created successfully.
The seventh line clears any effects produced by the transactor when creating the session, such as spawning or watching the child actor. This is done to simplify the assertion on the effects later.
The eighth line assigns the received actor reference to a variable called ref.
The ninth line asserts that the actor reference matches the child inbox of the test kit with the same name as the reference. This is done to verify that the child actor is indeed spawned by the transactor.
The tenth line creates a child test kit for testing the session behavior using the actor reference.
The eleventh line sends a Modify message to the session actor, requesting to increment the current value by one and reply with ‚Äúdone‚Äù.
The twelfth line runs one message processing cycle on the session actor, which should apply the modification and send back ‚Äúdone‚Äù to the done inbox.
The thirteenth line asserts that the done inbox has received exactly one ‚Äúdone‚Äù message, which means that the modification has been applied successfully.
The fourteenth line sends a Rollback message to the session actor, requesting to discard any changes and stop the actor.
The fifteenth line runs one message processing cycle on the session actor, which should stop itself and send a Terminated signal to the parent transactor.
The sixteenth line asserts that the done inbox has not received any more messages, which means that no further modifications have been made after the rollback.
The seventeenth line sends an Extract message to the session actor, requesting to extract and send back the current value as a string. This message should not be processed by the session actor, because it has already stopped.
The eighteenth line runs one message processing cycle on the session actor, which should do nothing because it is stopped.
The nineteenth line asserts that the done inbox has not received any more messages, which means that no extraction has been performed after the rollback.
The twentieth line asserts that the transactor‚Äôs self inbox has not received any messages, which means that no communication has happened between the parent and child actors after the rollback. This assertion might be redundant, because it is implied by the next assertion on the effects.
The twenty-first line sends a RolledBack message to
the transactor, pretending that it came from the child session actor. This message should not be handled by the transactor, because it only handles RolledBack messages from the current session actor, and the current session actor has changed after another Begin message. This is where your test fails, because you expect this message to produce an effect of stopping the child actor, but it does not.

The twenty-second line runs one message processing cycle on the transactor, which should do nothing because it does not handle this message.

The twenty-third line asserts that the only effect produced by the transactor is stopping the child actor with the same name as the reference. This assertion fails because no effect is produced by the transactor when it receives the RolledBack message.

The twenty-fourth line sends another Begin message to the transactor, requesting a new session.

The twenty-fifth line runs one message processing cycle on the transactor, which should spawn another child session actor and send its reference to the session inbox.

The twenty-sixth line asserts that the session inbox has received exactly one actor reference, which means that another session has been created successfully.

The twenty-seventh line assigns the received actor reference to a variable called ref2.

The twenty-eighth line asserts that the actor reference matches the child inbox of the test kit with the same name as the reference. This is done to verify that the child actor is indeed spawned by the transactor.

The twenty-ninth line creates a child test kit for testing the second session behavior using the actor reference.

The thirtieth line creates another test inbox for receiving integer messages from the second session actor.

The thirty-first line sends an Extract message to the second session actor, requesting to extract and send back the current value as an integer.

The thirty-second line runs one message processing cycle on the second session actor, which should send back the current value to the integer inbox.

The thirty-third line asserts that the integer inbox has received exactly one integer message, which should be equal to the initial value of the transactor. This means that the value has been rolled back to the original state after the first session was terminated.

In a different test, I see the lines ```    assert(
      effects.exists {
        case Effect.Scheduled(`sessionTimeout`, _, RolledBack(`ref`)) => true
        case _                                                        => false
      },
      "In case of timeout, the session should be rolled back"
    )```. Can yuo explain what Effect.Scheduled is?

According to the Akka documentation1, Effect.Scheduled is a type of effect that is produced by the behavior test kit when an actor schedules a message to be sent to another actor after a delay. It contains the delay duration, the target actor reference, and the message to be sent. You can use this effect to assert that your actor has scheduled a message correctly.

In your test, you are asserting that the transactor has scheduled a RolledBack message to itself after the session timeout, using the session actor reference as the message payload. This is done to verify that the transactor will rollback the value if the session actor does not commit or rollback within the timeout.

what is the difference between done.receiveAll and done.receiveAllEffects?
Searching for: akka typed done.receiveAll done.receiveAllEffects

Searching for: akka typed done.receiveAll done.receiveAllEffects

Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

According to the Akka documentation1, done.receiveAll is a method of the TestInbox class, which is used to create test probes for sending and receiving messages to and from actors. The receiveAll method returns a sequence of all messages that have been received by the test inbox since the last call to receiveAll or receiveMessage.

The done.receiveAllEffects method does not exist in the Akka Typed library. I think you might be confusing it with the retrieveAllEffects method of the BehaviorTestKit class, which is used to test the behavior of an actor without running an actor system. The retrieveAllEffects method returns a sequence of all effects that have been produced by the actor since the last call to retrieveAllEffects or retrieveEffect. Effects are actions that an actor can perform, such as spawning or stopping a child actor, watching or unwatching another actor, scheduling a message, or changing its own behavior.

``` any pointers?
I see you have added a line to send a Rollback message to the session actor in the inSession behavior when you receive a RolledBack message from the parent. I don‚Äôt think this is necessary, because the session actor should already stop itself when it receives a Rollback message from the parent, which is scheduled by the parent in the idle behavior. Sending another Rollback message to the session actor might cause some race conditions or unexpected effects.

I suggest you remove that line and instead handle the Terminated signal in the parent actor‚Äôs receiveSignal method. You can use the Behaviors.receiveSignal combinator to define how to react to signals. For example, you can add something like this to your inSession behavior:

.receiveSignal {
  case (ctx, Terminated(session)) =>
    if session == sessionRef then
      idle(rollbackValue, sessionTimeout)
    else
      Behaviors.same
}
Copy
This way, you can rollback the value when the session actor stops for any reason, not just when it receives a RolledBack message from the parent. This might make your tests pass.

what is the Behavior.isAlive method? Why is it a behavior that can be alive, rather than an actorref?
Searching for: akka typed Behavior.isAlive

Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

Generating answers for you‚Ä¶

The Behavior.isAlive method is a static method of the Behavior class that checks if a given behavior is still alive or has been stopped. It returns a boolean value. You can use this method to test if an actor has terminated its behavior by returning Behaviors.stopped1.

A behavior is a function that defines how an actor reacts to messages and signals. A behavior can change over time, by returning a new behavior from the function. An actor is an entity that has an address and can send and receive messages. An actor is associated with a behavior, but the behavior can change during the actor‚Äôs lifecycle. Therefore, it makes sense to check the aliveness of a behavior, not an actor. An actor can only be stopped by sending it a PoisonPill message or by stopping its parent actor2.

what does it mean for a behavior to be alive?
A behavior is alive if it can still process messages and signals. A behavior is stopped if it has returned Behaviors.stopped or thrown an exception. A stopped behavior will not process any more messages or signals, and will signal its parent actor and any watchers that it has terminated. A stopped behavior can also release any resources that it holds, such as timers or child actors.

The Effects.stopped is a type of effect that is produced by the behavior test kit when an actor stops itself or is stopped by its parent. It contains the name of the stopped actor. You can use this effect to assert that your actor has stopped correctly1.

In your test, you are expecting to see this effect when you send a RolledBack message to the transactor, which should stop the child session actor. However, as I explained before, this message is not handled by the transactor because it only handles RolledBack messages from the current session actor. Therefore, you don‚Äôt see this effect when you retrieve all effects.

Sorry, I didn't quite understand. Can you be more verbose about why I dont see this effect?
Sure, I‚Äôll try to explain in more detail.

When you send a Begin message to the transactor, it spawns a child session actor and sends its reference back to you. It also schedules a RolledBack message to itself after the session timeout, using the session actor reference as the message payload. This message is intended to rollback the value if the session actor does not commit or rollback within the timeout.

However, before the timeout expires, you send another Begin message to the transactor, which spawns another child session actor and sends its reference back to you. This also schedules another RolledBack message to itself after the session timeout, using the new session actor reference as the message payload. This message replaces the previous one, because the transactor only handles one session at a time.

Now, when you send a RolledBack message to the transactor manually, pretending that it came from the first session actor, the transactor ignores it, because it only handles RolledBack messages from the current session actor, which is the second one. Therefore, it does not stop the first session actor or produce any effect.

The first session actor will eventually receive a Rollback message from the transactor when the timeout expires, and it will stop itself and produce an effect. But this will happen after your test assertion, so you don‚Äôt see it.

Can you show me which test you're talking about?
I‚Äôm talking about the test that you posted earlier, where you wrote:

testkit.ref ! RolledBack(ref)
testkit.runOne()
assertEquals(testkit.retrieveAllEffects(), Seq(Effects.stopped(ref.path.name)))
Copy
This test fails because the RolledBack message is not handled by the transactor and no effect is produced.

If I assume the test is correct, how do I fix the code?
If you want the transactor to handle RolledBack messages from any session actor, not just the current one, you can change the inSession behavior to something like this:

private def inSession[T](
      rollbackValue: T,
      sessionTimeout: FiniteDuration,
      sessionRef: ActorRef[Session[T]]
  ): Behavior[PrivateCommand[T]] =
    Behaviors
      .receive {
        case (ctx, Begin(replyTo)) => Behaviors.unhandled
        case (ctx, Committed(session, value)) =>
          if session == sessionRef then idle(value, sessionTimeout)
          else Behaviors.same
        case (ctx, RolledBack(session)) =>
          ctx.stop(session) // stop the session actor explicitly
          idle(rollbackValue, sessionTimeout) // rollback the value and go back to idle
      }
Copy
This way, you will stop the session actor and rollback the value when you receive a RolledBack message from any session actor. This should make your test pass.

that's amazing. It fixed my errors. But I really don't understand why. I'm so sorry. Please explain to me, why do you say that I send a second Begin message? Why is there a second child?
No need to be sorry, I‚Äôm here to help. üòä

You send a second Begin message in your test, after you send the first RolledBack message. Here is the relevant part of your test:

testkit.ref ! RolledBack(ref)
testkit.runOne()
assertEquals(testkit.retrieveAllEffects(), Seq(Effects.stopped(ref.path.name)))

testkit.ref ! Begin(sessionInbox.ref)
testkit.runOne()
val refs2 = sessionInbox.receiveAll()
assert(refs2.size == 1, "A session should be created upon reception of the `Begin` message")
val ref2 = refs2.head
assertEquals(ref2, testkit.childInbox(ref2.path.name).ref)
val session2 = testkit.childTestKit(ref2)

val i = TestInbox[Int]()
session2.ref ! Extract((x: Int) => x, i.ref)
session2.runOne()
assertEquals(i.receiveAll(), Seq(start))
Copy
As you can see, you send another Begin message to the transactor, which spawns another child session actor and sends its reference back to you. This also schedules another RolledBack message to itself after the session timeout, using the new session actor reference as the message payload. This message replaces the previous one, because the transactor only handles one session at a time.

The second child session actor is created by the transactor when it receives the second Begin message. The transactor can only handle one session at a time, so it spawns a new child actor for each new session request. The previous child actor is not stopped by the transactor, but it will eventually stop itself when it receives a Rollback message from the transactor after the timeout expires.

what's tthe name of this test?
I don‚Äôt know the name of this test, because you didn‚Äôt provide it. Maybe you can tell me what is the name of the test class and the test method that contains this code.

i think there is " test("A Transactor must timeout") {" at the top?
I see. Then the name of this test is ‚ÄúA Transactor must timeout‚Äù. This name suggests that the purpose of this test is to verify that the transactor will rollback the value if the session actor does not commit or rollback within the timeout. However, your test also contains some extra steps that are not related to the timeout, such as sending a RolledBack message manually and starting another session. This might make your test more complicated and confusing. I suggest you simplify your test to only focus on the timeout scenario, and move the other steps to a separate test.

its a little confusing yes
I understand. Testing actors can be tricky sometimes. Do you have any other questions or doubts about your code or tests? I‚Äôm happy to help you as much as I can. üòä

earlier you said "The twenty-first line sends a RolledBack message to
the transactor, pretending that it came from the child session actor. This message should not be handled by the transactor, because it only handles RolledBack messages from the current session actor, and the current session actor has changed after another Begin message. This is where your test fails, because you expect this message to produce an effect of stopping the child actor, but it does not." but why don't I see the Effect.stopped when the 14th line has already occured, where "The fourteenth line sends a Rollback message to the session actor, requesting to discard any changes and stop the actor"?
Good question. The reason you don‚Äôt see the Effect.stopped when the 14th line has already occurred is because the behavior test kit does not run the scheduled messages automatically. You have to run them manually by calling the testkit.runAll() method. This method will run all messages that have been scheduled by the actor, including the Rollback message that was sent to the session actor by the transactor.

If you call testkit.runAll() before retrieving the effects, you should see the Effect.stopped that you expect.

How do I save a transcript of my conversation with you?
Unfortunately, there is no built-in feature to save a transcript of your conversation with me. However, you can try to copy and paste the chat messages into a text editor or a document and save it as a file. Alternatively, you can take screenshots of the chat window and save them as images. I hope this helps. üòä
